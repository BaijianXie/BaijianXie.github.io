					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned about various principles and rules for animation in user interface (UI) design. It covers topics like the duration and speed of animations, the use of easing for natural movement, different types of animation curves, and choreography in interface animations. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite thing about this post is that it gives examples of visual contrasts. It contrasts the differences in the animation curves. Gave me a better understanding of what the text was saying. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Animation in the interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction, acceleration, etc. Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p>I would give it an 8 because of the animated examples.</p>
