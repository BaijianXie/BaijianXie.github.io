                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned from this post that there are various ways of user experience. For example, users can slide down, so create some animations for that. There are also animations for entering the page that can attract the user as well.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite thing is that the author shows a lot of interface interaction. Many comparisons are generated and you can see different animations that are very interesting on different pages. I thoroughly enjoyed switching back and forth between the different animations. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Index&Sidebar Animation by Arvin appeals to me the most as it shows the interaction in bankcard software. It has a pointer that grows as it moves. And I also like that its menu screen doesn't completely overlay another screen. </p>
