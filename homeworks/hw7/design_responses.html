					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this post I learned how psychology and design are mutual. Because we associate things that we recognize. This adds variety to the design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part is that it explains the brain's own design. Because that's what I always do, automatically draw the big picture. So it guides me deeper into a site. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “It has its own “weird” way of perceiving shape and form, grouping information, fill in the gaps to draw the big picture.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> I would give it a score of 7. </p>
