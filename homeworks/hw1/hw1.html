<p>Hi, My name is Baijian Xie, when I have free time I play games, and watch videos. 
One of my favorite games is League of Legends. This has made me interested in the electronic world, 
so I've enjoyed learning web programming and making friends that share same interests.

<p>I learned that for design is something that needs to be thought about and can be improved. 
So when looking at a web page, analyze it. What attracted me the most to this article was its clear formatting. 
It uses bold, and font size and so on to organize. What attracted me the most was the sentence 
"If you could see the harsh drop shadows and unnecessary flourish I added to things, you would gasp in horror." 
I learned that I learned to be clear about the audience and to try to get used to the format of a web page. Overall I would give it an 8.</p>
